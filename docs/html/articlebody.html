<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this article I'm going to explain what I now consider to be a common problem<br />
among c# application developers. I'll delve into depth with various concepts<br />
that I needed to tackle in order to solve the initial problem I'm going to describe,<br />
and I'll also provide a complete solution with code explanations and a library project for you to use.<br />
Our target environment is going to be <em>.net standard 2.0</em>.  </p>
<p>So, in this article we shall see:</p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction to the MVC pattern and INotifyPropertyChanged</li>
<li>The decorator pattern</li>
<li>DispatchProxy and AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)</li>
<li>C# Expression Trees and Reflection Optimizations</li>
<li>The Observer Class</li>
</ul>
<h1>A quick glance on MVC</h1>
<p>MVC is a quite common pattern, based on a simple idea.<br />
The separation of program logic and UI pressentation.<br />
In this article, I won't go into details,<br />
but I provide a wikipedia article at the bottom, for anyone interested.<br />
Instead, I will focus on what background idea I need for this article.  </p>
<p>Consider the following class...</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class Foo {

    public int Number{ get; set; } = 0;

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>A pretty simple class with a single property, which holds the data our UI is<br />
going to need, to somehow pressent to the user.<br />
Ideally, I would like to somehow connect my separate UI code to this class.<br />
So when Number changes, the UI should be automatically updated, without<br />
Foo having any idea about the UI related code.  </p>
<p><img alt="Simple MVC" src="resources/img_01.svg" /></p>
<p>Now this pattern has a few benefits, but one I find particularly useful is unit testing.  <br />
Since the UI simply reflects the state of the Logic unit, the UI is irrelevant to the<br />
program logic itself.<br />
User interaction with the UI still affects program state of course,<br />
but the effect flow is as shown below.  </p>
<p><img alt="MVC Control Flow" src="resources/img_02.svg" /></p>
<p>This means we can now unit test our program logic, without paying any attention to the UI.  </p>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">this</a> wikipedia article for more details.</p>
<h1>INotifyPropertyChanged</h1>
<p>In the above presentation, we assumed that each time the logic unit's state changes,<br />
so does the UI get updated. One way to achieve this is, by setting up an event<br />
listener on the UI's end, and firing relevant events from the logic unit<br />
each time a change occurs on one of its properties.  </p>
<p>This sounds like a lot of work. Luckily, WPF for example, has mechanisms to<br />
automate most of it. In fact, only a tiny part of that work is left on the hands of<br />
the developer, and by the end of the article, hopefully, we shall know how to minimize even that.</p>
<p>INotifyPropertyChanged is an interface which is part of the .Net Standard.<br />
An implementation of INotifyPropertyChanged on the above class Foo would look like this:</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class Foo : INotifyPropertyChanged {

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    private int number = 0;
    public int Number{ 
        get =&gt; number;
        set {
            if(number == value) return;
            number = value;
            PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(Number)));
        }
    }

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>So we see that INotifyPropertyChanged only requires us to setup an event.<br />
Whenever a property is altered, with the above set block code, we can<br />
fire an event to anyone bound to PropertyChanged handler, and provide the<br />
name of the altered property.</p>
<p>You might wonder, why use INotifyPropertyChanged, instead of your own, custom interface.<br />
And the answer is that this is the default way to do it, and consistency means<br />
other developers will find your code easier to navigate.</p>
<p>Another reason is that WPF and Xamarin for example, with the use of bindings<br />
can use this specific Interface to track changes to your logic unit,<br />
and automatically update the UI.</p>
<p>This, of course, is tremendously important, when implementing the MVVM pattern,<br />
which for all we care on this article, is similar to the MVC pattern above.</p>
<h1>Defining the problem</h1>
<p>I think the problem we are going to solve, is already visible, if one pays attention.<br />
We simply have to take a look at the initial Foo class.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class Foo {

    public int Number{ get; set; } = 0;

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>And then, let's have another look at the class implementing INotifyPropertyChanged.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class Foo : INotifyPropertyChanged {

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    private int number = 0;
    public int Number{ 
        get =&gt; number;
        set {
            if(number == value) return;
            number = value;
            PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(Number)));
        }
    }

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>That's a lot of code... Boilerplate code. The problem scales aggressively,<br />
relative to the number of properties we end up having. It is not uncommon for an<br />
object to need to have tens of properties.</p>
<p>The code becomes too much, and as you can image the possibility of error<br />
increases with the lines of code. Now image the common as well scenario,<br />
that you have multiple objects, with multiple properties each.  </p>
<p>Not only the codebase scales, but you also have to type the same thing all the time,<br />
which is, frankly, annoying... And after all this typing, you end up with a robust program<br />
which implements a very simple idea... Again, and again...</p>
<p>Alternatively, I would like to have to type something like this to solve the above problem:</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class Foo : INotifyPropertyChanged {

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    [NotifyProperty]
    private int Number{ get; set; } = 0;

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Much better... Let's see how this could be done.</p>
<h1>The Decorator Pattern</h1>
<p>The decorator pattern is pretty straightforward.<br />
Consider having a few classes that share some functionality and thus they<br />
implement the same interface. Like the Food and Calorie example below.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public interface IHasCalories {
    int Calories{ get; }
}

public abstract class Food : IHasCalories {
    public abstract int Calories{ get; }
}

public class Pizza : Food {
    public override int Calories{ get =&gt; 500; }
}

public class Broccoli : Food {
    public override int Calories { get =&gt; 50; }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Each food type has a calories property, and each one returns a different value.  </p>
<p>The decorator pattern simply describes a wrapper class that further modifies<br />
the initial common functionality, and thus it <em>'decorates'</em> the existing classes.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class HugePortion : IHasCalories {
    private IHasCalories caloriePossesor;

    public HugePortion(IHasCalories caloriePossesor) {
        this.caloriePossesor = caloriePossesor;
    }

    public int Calories {
        get =&gt; caloriePossesor.Calories * 2;
    }
}

public class WithExtraCheese : IHasCalories {
    private IHasCalories caloriePossesor;

    public WithExtraCheese(IHasCalories caloriePossesor) {
        this.caloriePossesor = caloriePossesor;
    }

    public int Calories {
        get =&gt; caloriePossesor.Calories + 250;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <em>HugePortion</em> and <em>WithExtraCheese</em> implements the <em>IHasCalories</em> interface.<br />
Each of them also has a constructor that accepts an object of type <em>IHasCalories</em>.<br />
So they in a way <em>are</em> an <em>IHasCalories</em> object, and they also <em>have</em> an <em>IHasCalories</em> object.  </p>
<p>When a decorator object is tasked with providing calories, the base value comes from the<br />
actual object, and then it is further modified by the decorator. The decorator,<br />
cannot return a value if there's no decorated object to get the initial value from.</p>
<p>Intuitively, it makes no sense to have the calories of a huge portion, unless you are referring<br />
to a specific kind of food, like pizza or broccoli.<br />
Yet again, once food is decorated, you can refer to it simply as a common calorie bearing item,<br />
through the common interface <em>IHasCalories</em>.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the above pattern is that you can further decorate an <em>IHasCalories</em> object,<br />
even if the object to be decorated, is a decorator itself!<br />
Consider the following example:</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>IHasCalories food = new WithExtraCheese(new HugePortion(new Pizza()));
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now this is a huge portion of a pizza with extra cheese.<br />
First the <em>Pizza</em> object is created, then it is decorated by <em>HugePortion</em>, which is further<br />
decorated by <em>WithExtraCheese</em>, and the final food item is referred to as an <em>IHasCalories</em> object.  </p>
<p>When <em>food.Calories</em> is requested,<br />
<em>'WithExtraCheese'</em> calls <em>'HugePortion.Calories'</em> which calls <em>'Pizza.Calories'</em>.<br />
<em>'Pizza.Calories'</em> returns 500 to <em>'HugePortion'</em>, which doubles that and returns 1000 to <em>'WithExtraCheese'</em>,<br />
which adds another 250 calories, and finally <em>'food.Calories'</em> responds with an abundant 1250 calories.</p>
<p><img alt="Decorator Example" src="resources/img_03.svg" /></p>
<p>And finally a generic and simplified way to see the pattern...</p>
<p><img alt="Decorator Simplified" src="resources/img_04.svg" /></p>
<h1>The DispatchProxy class</h1>
<p>Based upon the principles of the Decorator pattern, the DispatchProxy class exists to provide<br />
a more generic way to alter the functionality of our concrete classes.<br />
DispatchProxy is an abstract class, which means we have to extend it.<br />
I shall be calling the extended class, simply <strong>Proxy</strong>.</p>
<p>The Proxy class is very simple, it inherits a single abstract method <em>Invoke</em><br />
from its parent DispatchProxy, and a static generic method, <em>Create</em>, as shown below.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class Proxy : DispatchProxy {
    protected override object Invoke( MethodInfo targetMethod, object[] args ) {

    }
}

public static T Create&lt;T,TProxy&gt; () where TProxy : System.Reflection.DispatchProxy;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Those two are the only building blocks we are going to need to create wrapper objects<br />
with specific functionality for any object type.  </p>
<p>Remember the previous example with food. The decorator object needed to implement the<br />
same Interface as the object it wrapped.</p>
<p>What if I wanted to decorate many different types of objects with different interfaces,<br />
with the same functionality? A very common use for such a problem is logging.<br />
You would like your objects to log to a file each of their method invocations.  </p>
<p>So a simplistic way to do it, would be to implement that functionality on every method of each one<br />
of your objects. As you can imagine this quickly becomes bloated, frustrating, and error prone.<br />
Another way, would be to implement the decorator pattern for each different object.<br />
This is viable, but you'd still have to repeat the same code for each method,<br />
and a different decorator for each object.</p>
<p>I hope the problem is clear. Let's see how the above Proxy class works now.<br />
I actually prefer to declare my Proxy class like this:</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>class Proxy&lt;ObjectType, ObjectInterface&gt;  : DispatchProxy 
    where ObjectType : ObjectInterface{

    private ObjectType instance;

    protected override object Invoke( MethodInfo targetMethod, object[] args ) {

    }

    static public ObjectInterface Generate(ObjectType instance) {
        ObjectInterface proxy = DispatchProxy.Create
            &lt;ObjectInterface, Proxy&lt;ObjectType, ObjectInterface&gt;&gt;();
        (proxy as Proxy&lt;ObjectType, ObjectInterface&gt;).instance = instance;
        return proxy;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note how I made my Proxy a generic class, taking two generic type parameters.<br />
Firstly, the <strong>ObjectType</strong> (that should translate as the concrete class in your mind),<br />
and secondly, <strong>ObjectInterface</strong> (that should translate as the common interface<br />
shared between the decorator and the concrete class in your mind).  </p>
<p>I also made my proxy class keep an instance of the actual concrete class object.<br />
This might prove handy in the future.</p>
<p>And finally, let's see the Generate method. The Generate method somehow connects<br />
three separate entities. The Proxy class, the concrete class, and the common interface.</p>
<p><strong>The DispatchProxy.Create method, generates</strong> dynamically at runtime, <br />
<strong>an object that's derived from Proxy class and implements ObjectInterface.</strong>  </p>
<p>We don't actually know or care exactly what that generated object is, all we care about<br />
is that we can use it as if it were a Proxy object (which actually it is through inheritance),<br />
and we can also use it as the common interface, since we know that it implements it.  </p>
<p><strong>When the returned generated object</strong> (that we, in our application can work with<br />
through the common interface) <strong>invokes a method, what is actually invoked is the Proxy.Invoke method.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Proxy Schema" src="resources/img_05.svg" /></p>
<p>The Proxy.Invoke method gets as an argument a MethodInfo object related to the actual<br />
method of the ObjectType that should have been invoked. And as you image, args are the actual<br />
method arguments that were passed when the method invocation took place.</p>
<p>Let's see a simple example to make things clear.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public interface CommonInterface {
    void PrintHello();
}

public class ConcreteClass : CommonInterface {

    public void PrintHello() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    }

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above snippet should require no explanation, we have our ConcreteClass with a simple<br />
method, that's also declared in the CommonInterface that it implements.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class Proxy&lt;ObjectType, ObjectInterface&gt;  : DispatchProxy 
    where ObjectType : ObjectInterface{

    private ObjectType instance;

    protected override object Invoke( MethodInfo targetMethod, object[] args ) {
        Console.WriteLine("Calling " + targetMethod.Name);
        object result = targetMethod.Invoke(instance, args);
        Console.WriteLine("Called " + targetMethod.Name);
        return result;
    }

    static public ObjectInterface Generate(ObjectType instance) {
        ObjectInterface proxy = DispatchProxy.Create
            &lt;ObjectInterface, Proxy&lt;ObjectType, ObjectInterface&gt;&gt;();
        (proxy as Proxy&lt;ObjectType, ObjectInterface&gt;).instance = instance;
        return proxy;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Proxy class is exactly the same as before, with its invoke method implemented too.<br />
So in this example, before the target method gets invoked, we print to the console<br />
the method to be invoked. Then, through reflection we call the target method<br />
of the concrete object. Finally, we print the name of the method just invoked.</p>
<p>Note that the original method invocation through the decorated object was<br />
altered in no way, as expected.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>ConcreteClass concrete = new ConcreteClass();
CommonInterface decorated = Proxy&lt;ConcreteClass, CommonInterface&gt;.Generate(concrete);
decorated.PrintHello();
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above snippet of code creates a Concrete class, generates the decorated object,<br />
and through it, calls the method defined in the common interface that prints hello.<br />
As mentioned before, the method actually invoked is Proxy.Invoke, which in turn<br />
calls through reflection the target method.  </p>
<p>The above snippet prints:<br />
Calling PrintHello<br />
Hello<br />
Called PrintHello  </p>
<p>So to sum it all up, with DispatchProxy, we solved a common problem (logging)<br />
on all methods of every object, by generating dynamically at runtime a decorator.<br />
We only had to define an interface to our class(es) if it didn't already exist.  </p>
<h1>DispatchProxy Invoke Optimizations</h1>
<p>As great as DispatchProxy is, it comes with a steep cost in performance.<br />
Each method invocation makes use of reflection, which is, in fact,
quite slow compared to normal method invocations.</p>
<p>Ideally, we'd be able to call the correct target method directly, without<br />
the use of reflection, by passing an array of object arguments to it as parameters.<br />
So our invocation method would be something like this:</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>private static Dictionary&lt;MethodInfo, Func&lt;object, object[], object&gt;&gt; MethodsMappings { get; }

protected override object Invoke( MethodInfo targetMethod, object[] args ) {
    Console.WriteLine("Calling " + targetMethod.Name);
    object result = MethodsMappings[targetMethod].Invoke(instance, args);
    Console.WriteLine("Called " + targetMethod.Name);
    return result;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>First take a look at the dictionary MethodMappings. This dictionary simply maps<br />
a MethodInfo to a Func<object, object[], object> delegate, which accepts an object and an array<br />
of objects as parameters and returns an object.<br />
(The last generic type is the return type of the delegate)</p>
<p>This is a pretty generic delegate. Its first argument is the concrete class that the invoked<br />
method belongs to. Its second argument is the arguments that Proxy.Invoke provides us with<br />
for the method invocation, and its return type is an object with the real return value<br />
of invoked method.</p>
<p>A delegate is fast, no less fast on average than a method invocation, and certainly<br />
much faster than reflection. But what is the delegate's body?<br />
We somehow want it to execute the original method, upon the concrete object.</p>
<p>The problem here is we have no idea about the original method's signature,<br />
but in order to not have some kind of reflection or argument types deduction of some sort,<br />
we are going to need solid types of delegates, like the above Func.</p>
<p>Let's see what we would do if we knew the type of the target method.<br />
Suppose we have the following concrete method.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class ConcreteClass : CommonInterface {

    public int Sum(int x, int y) {
        return x+y;
    }

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>If we knew what type of method we would be calling, we could simply create the generic<br />
Func<object, object[], object> above, and instantiate it like this:  </p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>Func&lt;object, object[], object&gt; func = (object instance, object[] args) =&gt; {
    int x = (int) args[0];
    int y = (int) args[1];

    return (object) (instance as ConcreteClass).Sum(x, y);
};
</code></pre></div>
<p>So as we see, our generic Func object acts as a wrapper to our actual method.  </p>
<p>For anyone unfamiliar with the above syntax, the func is instantiated with a lambda<br />
expression, which you can think of as an unnamed function.<br />
The syntax consists of 3 parts, the arguments, the lambda declarator, and the body.<br />
The following is a simple lambda function: </p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>() =&gt; { }
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a function with no arguments that does nothing, note the <strong>'=&gt;'</strong> is the lambda declarator<br />
syntax to create a delegate. The parentheses declare the arguments, similar to how a method does,<br />
and the brackets declare the function body.  </p>
<p>So, if we could create variations of the above Func<object, object[], object> wrapper object depending<br />
on the target method each time at runtime, we could implement our Proxy.Invoke method as above. </p>
<p>The benefit is we'd have two delegate invocations (fast) instead of an invocation through reflection (slow).<br />
We'd have to setup the dictionary once for each concrete type (slow initialization),<br />
but afterwards we can use the decorated objects with almost no extra invocation cost of their methods.</p>
<h1>Expression Trees</h1>
<p>For anyone having had a compilers class at university, expression trees should be pretty<br />
straightforward, at least theoretically.<br />
Expression trees are the way .Net creates a syntax tree at runtime, from which it can compile<br />
executable chunks of code that reside on memory.</p>
<p>An example of a syntax tree in the English language is provided below.</p>
<p><img alt="Syntax Tree English" src="resources/img_06.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see there are lots of intermediate nodes that make ever higher level expressions<br />
up to the root of the tree. Similarly, when a compiler parses the source code, it creates such<br />
hierarchical structures to "<em>make sense</em>" of it.</p>
<p>Getting into more details would be too much for this article, so I'm just going<br />
to describe why this is useful to us to solve the above problem.</p>
<p>Let's focus on the fact that <strong>an expression tree can be created and compiled at runtime</strong><br />
<strong>to provide executable chunks of code</strong>.  </p>
<p>In other words, expression trees can provide us with methods, or delegates, which are<br />
generated at runtime. So in the problem above, couldn't we simply create an appropriate<br />
Func<object, object[], object> object wrapper of our method?<br />
Yes we could. In fact, we could extract the parameters and return type of any method from<br />
its MethodInfo, and generate a wrapper specifically for it.</p>
<p>Once the generated Func object is returned, we could never know exactly what lies below<br />
the shell that's our wrapper class, and we don't need to know, as long as the target method<br />
invocation is ultimately correct.  </p>
<h1>The Delegate Generator Class</h1>
<p>This class is going to be key in our implementation. It only has a simple thing to do.<br />
Get a MethodInfo as an argument and generate a generic delegate of it.<br />
The class' public method is straightforward.  </p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>    public static class DelegateGenerator {

        public static Func&lt;object, object[], object&gt; GenerateDetached(MethodInfo method, object instance) {
            //...
        }

    }
</code></pre></div>
<p>And that's really all there is to it. The internal functionality does require a little bit of work,<br />
as someone has to check every possible method signature and generate the approptiate expression tree.<br />
I am not going to provide it in detail here. Source code is your best bet if you need more details.<br />
Instead, I will explain the basic idea of how this class, and expression trees work.</p>
<p>So, assume we have the following class:</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class ConcreteClass : CommonInterface {

    public int Sum(int x, int y) {
        return x+y;
    }

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>We will try to emulate the following behavior, using expression trees:</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>Func&lt;object, object[], object&gt; func = (object instance, object[] args) =&gt; {
    int x = (int) args[0];
    int y = (int) args[1];

    return (object) (instance as ConcreteClass).Sum(x, y);
};
</code></pre></div>
<p>Remember, that this Func<object, object[], object> is actually what our DelegateGenerator returns.<br />
So if we know how to create that at runtime using expression trees, our work is done.<br />
And the way to do that, is pretty straightforward using Expression Trees.</p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>    //our object initialization
    ConcreteClass obj = new ConcreteClass();

    //The received parameter type, the type received by "final"
    ParameterExpression outer = Expression.Parameter(typeof(object[]));

    //A call expression
    var call = Expression.Call(
        Expression.Constant(obj), //param 0 : the object that the call is associated with
        obj.GetType().GetMethod("Sum"), //param 1 : the methodInfo using reflection
        //param 2 : a conversion of the received outer[0] from object type to int type, expression
        Expression.Convert(Expression.ArrayIndex(outer, Expression.Constant(0)), typeof(int)),
        //param 3 : a conversion of the received outer[1] from object type to int type, expression
        Expression.Convert(Expression.ArrayIndex(outer, Expression.Constant(1)), typeof(int))
    );

    //the body of our lambda, which is an expression that uses the previously
    //defined call expression, and converts its return type (int) to object
    var body = Expression.Convert(call, typeof(object));

    //our callable, compiled, lambda expression
    //that receives an array of objects and returns object
    var final = Expression.Lambda&lt;Func&lt;object[], object&gt;&gt;(
        body, outer).Compile();

    //Calling our delegate, which prints 8 as expected
    Console.WriteLine(final.Invoke(new object[]{ 3, 5 }).ToString());
</code></pre></div>
<p>So, with the above example, we managed to create the desired delegate at runtime, using expression trees.<br />
The basic idea is pressented in this minor example. Finding all the required method signature information<br />
is simply then a matter of effort, using reflection, to create the appropriate "generic" delegate of any method.<br />
The source code, that does exactly that, is already provided.  </p>
<p>Microsoft provides detailed documentation on expression trees, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/">here</a></p>
<h1>Proxy class optimization</h1>
<p>Remember our Proxy class.  </p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>public class Proxy&lt;ObjectType, ObjectInterface&gt;  : DispatchProxy 
    where ObjectType : ObjectInterface{

    private ObjectType instance;

    protected override object Invoke( MethodInfo targetMethod, object[] args ) {
        //...
    }

    static public ObjectInterface Generate(ObjectType instance) {
        //...
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>When a new Proxy type is initialized for the first time, we actually (through reflection),<br />
have all the information we need (all the class types, and their associated method types),<br />
to generate the appropriate Dictionary which maps methodInfo types, to the generic delegates we<br />
created using DelegateGenerator. So when invoke is called by our decorated method,<br />
we don't actually need to use reflection!<br />
We can just use reflection once per proxy type, to initialize our dictionary!<br />
This is a huge optimization! Since reflection is so much slower than delegates.<br />
We handle all the initialization code, in Proxy's static constructor.  </p>
<h1>The Observer class</h1>
<p>The techniques we discussed above, can be used to solve a great variety of problems.<br />
But our initial objective was to be able to decorate our classes with appropriate Attributes,<br />
to automatically fire the INotifyPropertyChanged event, as shown below.  </p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>    public class Foo : INotifyPropertyChanged {

        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

        [NotifyProperty]
        private int Number{ get; set; } = 0;

    }
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Observer class, can be used to do exactly that. It is a Proxy class (derived from DispatchProxy),<br />
which generates, just as we did before, a decorated class that wraps the concrete class.<br />
As before, its methods and properties are accessed through the returned interface, but,<br />
the Observer class makes sure, that when a property is altered (set), the ObservedChanged event is fired.  </p>
<p>I will provide an example of the whole proccess, to make things clear.  </p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>    //the decorator interface has to be derived from IObserver
    public interface IFoo : IObserver{

        //The [Observe] attribute has to be used on every property that requires observation
        //aka: to fire the appropriate event when altered.
        [Observe]
        Number { get; set; }

    }

    //The concrete class has to define its interface, IFoo
    public class Foo : IFoo {

        public int Number{ get; set; } = 0;

        //This method has to be defined. Observation can be used to do any type of action, as desired.
        //Including, but not limited to, firing the INotifyPropertyChanged event, we discussed earlier.
        public void ObservedChanged( string propertyname ) {
            //take action when an observed property changed.
        }

    }
</code></pre></div>
<p>The following snippet provides a usage example:  </p>
<div class='codebox'><pre><code>//concrete object creation
Foo concreteObject = new Foo();

//decorated object instantiation
IFoo decorated = Observer&lt;Foo, IFoo&gt;.GenerateProxy(original);

//This would invoke ObservedChanged
decorared.Number = 5;
</code></pre></div>
<h1>Epilogue</h1>
<p>I hope you found this article to be useful. Remember, I provide a complete implementation of<br />
everything discussed above, with unit testing, on Github. Other projects aim to have a similar<br />
functionality, but my implementation is not dependent on any external packages,<br />
just pure C# and .net standard 2.</p>
